title: "guidelines for attaching a FylloClip sensor"
---

When attaching a FylloClip sensor, there are a few simple basic rules to follow:

-   The sensor should be attached to a **sun-exposed, fully developed leaf**.

-   The sensor should **not be placed on prominent leaf veins**, as this creates too much space between the sensor and the leaf blade.

-   The sensor's **cables should be secured to the petiole** (leaf stalk). This allows the sensor to move with the leaf and shoot, preventing it from being stripped off the leaf in strong winds. Easily bendable binding wire is well-suited for this purpose.

-   If a leaf is not exposed to the sun all day, such as with north-south oriented plant rows, it may be useful to place one sensor on the east side and a second on the west side of the plant.
