The purpose of this site is to enable anyone to build his or her own microcontroller board with FylloClip sensors and to put it into action. Finally, this should allow you to monitor the water status of plants with remote transmission of the data from the field to the cloud, so that you can control on your PC or mobile phone at any time and from any place whether your plants ente in a condition of water stress.

The entire system can be replicated at very limited costs and requires only basic skills in electronics (such as handling a soldering iron) and some experience in working with microcontrollers, in particular with Arduino.
