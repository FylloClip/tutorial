This site aims to enable anyone to create and deploy their own microcontroller board with FylloClip sensors. Ultimately, this will enable you to remotely monitor the water status of plants, transmitting data from the field to the cloud. Consequently, you can check on your PC or mobile phone, anytime and anywhere, if they are experiencing water stress.

This entire system can be replicated at a very low cost and requires only basic electronics skills (like soldering) and some familiarity with microcontrollers, particularly Arduino.

The scientific background and working principle of these foliar sensors, named FylloClip due to their paperclip-like attachment, are explained in detail in the following publication: \
