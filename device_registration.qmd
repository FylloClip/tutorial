title: "device registration on TTN"
---

Each device needs to be registered on the 'The Things Network' platform (TTN) for becoming fully operational.

First, create a free account on The Things Network: <https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/get-started>

Once you have created your account, you need to create a so called 'application', which can be considered as a collection of end devices to be handled in a similar manner, concerning structure and transmission of their data.

Next, you can start with the registration of end devices (each FylloClip module would be a single new end device)

Follow the settings in the subsequent screenshots (if you're located outside of Europe select the frequency plan applicable to your region).

next, select ABP and generate the DevEUI and the various keys:

After registration we have to edit the newly created device to add a few further and to copy the keys we need to insert into the Arduino sketch

Scroll down and expand the Network layer settings

Scroll down and open the advanced MAC settings

Click 9 times on the 'add frequency' button to add 9 empty fields

In those fields insert the following frequencies, this example reports the frequencies used for Europe (868 MHz frequency band), which are 868100000, 868300000, 868500000, 867100000, 867300000, 867500000, 867700000, 867900000, 868800000. Add the end save the changes.

Now we retrieve the keys to be inserted into the Arduino sketch. Return to 'Device overview'

Make NwkSKey and AppSKey visible

Move the cursor to the right side of the key fields to activate the formatting options, the change the format as follows. At the end copy each key using the copy function and insert them in the respective positions of the [Arduino sketch](https://github.com/FylloClip/tutorial/blob/main/ressources/Arduino%20code/FylloClip_2025/FylloClip_2025.ino).

You can also specify a unique ID number for your device (line 12 of the code), which may be helpful for later data handling. At this point the sketch id ready for upload onto your device.
