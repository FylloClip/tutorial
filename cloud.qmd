title: "storing the data in the cloud"
---

In the paragraph [*device registration on TTN*](https://fylloclip.github.io/tutorial/device_registration.html)we have seen how an end device (FylloClip module) is registered on the TTN network. With this we enabled the data flow from the device in the field to the TTN network server, provided of course that there is TTN coverage at the site, which means that there needs to be a LoRa-gateway connected to TTN somewhere in the area. On [TTNmapper](https://ttnmapper.org/) you can find out if there is already TTN coverage in a specific location. If not, you will need to install your own LoRa gateway and register it on TTN.

As already mentioned in [*device registration on TTN*](https://fylloclip.github.io/tutorial/device_registration.html), the TTN network server cannot be used for storing data. But we can provide instructions for the data to be forwarded to another destination in the cloud where the data can b stored in a database. There are various approaches to achieve this goal, what is explained here is just one of them and consists in forwarding the data, which have already been formatted to a JSON object (according to the *payload formatter* inserted when creating the *application* on TTN), to another website which provides a hosting service. There are many free web hosting services out there, for this tutorial we use [altervista.org](https://en.altervista.org/).

As the first step, you need to create your own (free) account [there](https://en.altervista.org/create-free-site.php). Choose the option *Hosting with file manager*. Although there appears a monthly cost, there will be the option for a free account at the next step.
